## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`IntelligentHealthAgent`** - Main orchestration service
2. **`AppointmentService`** - Booking and scheduling logic
3. **`NotificationService`** - Email and alert system
4. **`DoctorRecommendationService`** - Specialist matching (existing)

### Database Models

- **`Appointment`** - Appointment records with status tracking
- **`DoctorAvailability`** - Doctor scheduling information
- **`AgentRecommendation`** - Agent analysis results and actions
- **`User`** - Enhanced with medical specialty and booking preferences

### API Endpoints

#### 🤖 **Intelligent Health Agent** (`/agent/`)
- `POST /agent/analyze-and-act` - Main agent analysis endpoint
- `POST /agent/process-ocr-analysis` - Direct OCR integration
- `GET /agent/recommendations/{analysis_id}` - Get specific recommendations
- `GET /agent/my-recommendations` - Patient recommendation history
- `GET /agent/statistics` - Usage statistics

#### 📅 **Appointments** (`/appointments/`)
- `POST /appointments/book` - Manual appointment booking
- `POST /appointments/auto-book` - Automatic booking
- `GET /appointments/my-appointments` - User appointment list
- `PUT /appointments/{id}/status` - Update appointment status
- `GET /appointments/available-doctors` - Find available doctors
- `POST /appointments/availability` - Set doctor availability

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### 1. Document Upload & Analysis
```
Patient uploads medical report → OCR extracts metrics → Analysis saved to database
```

### 2. Intelligent Agent Processing
```python
# Trigger agent analysis
POST /agent/process-ocr-analysis
{
    "analysis_id": 123,
    "auto_book_critical": true
}
```

### 3. Critical Value Detection
The agent automatically detects critical values based on thresholds:
- **Glucose > 11.0 mmol/L** → Urgent endocrinologist
- **Liver enzymes > 100 U/L** → Gastroenterologist  
- **Creatinine > 150 μmol/L** → Nephrologist
- **Hemoglobin < 90 g/L** → Hematologist
- **Positive infectious markers** → Infectious disease specialist

### 4. Automatic Actions
For high-priority cases, the agent:
1. ✅ Identifies appropriate specialist type
2. ✅ Finds available doctors
3. ✅ Books earliest available appointment
4. ✅ Sends notifications to patient and doctor
5. ✅ Records all actions in database

## 🔧 Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# OpenRouter API for enhanced AI analysis (optional)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key

# Email notifications (optional)
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@aihealthtracker.com
```

### Database Migration
The system adds new tables that will be created automatically:
- `appointments` - Appointment records
- `doctor_availability` - Doctor scheduling
- `agent_recommendations` - Agent analysis results

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. **Emergency Health Alerts**
```
Critical glucose detected (15.5 mmol/L) 
→ Agent books urgent endocrinologist appointment
→ Patient receives critical health alert
→ Doctor receives urgent case notification
```

### 2. **Routine Health Monitoring**
```
Elevated ALT detected (66.19 U/L)
→ Agent recommends gastroenterologist consultation
→ Patient receives health analysis report
→ Manual booking suggested for non-critical cases
```

### 3. **Multiple Condition Management**
```
Multiple abnormal values detected
→ Agent prioritizes most critical specialist
→ Books primary appointment automatically
→ Recommends additional specialists for manual booking
```
