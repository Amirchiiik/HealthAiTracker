# AI Health Tracker - Development Log

## Current Task: Individual Metric Explanations Implementation

### Context
The system currently generates a single general explanation for entire medical reports. The goal is to modify it so each individual health metric (Hemoglobin, Glucose, etc.) receives its own separate explanation.

### Current System Architecture
