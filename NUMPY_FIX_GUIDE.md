# NumPy Compatibility Fix Guide

## 🔧 Issue Fixed: NumPy 2.x Compatibility

### ❌ Problem
The project was encountering this error when starting:
```
ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject
```

### 🔍 Root Cause
- NumPy was upgraded to version 2.2.1
- Packages like `easyocr`, `torch`, and `scikit-image` were compiled against NumPy 1.x
- NumPy 2.x has breaking changes that cause binary incompatibility

### ✅ Solution Applied
1. **Downgraded NumPy** to a compatible 1.x version:
   ```bash
   pip install "numpy<2.0" --force-reinstall
   ```

2. **Updated requirements.txt** to prevent future issues:
   ```
   numpy<2.0,>=1.26.0
   ```

3. **Created fixed startup script** (`start_server.sh`) that ensures compatibility

### 🚀 How to Run the Project Now

**Option 1: Use the fixed startup script (Recommended)**
```bash
./start_server.sh
```

**Option 2: Manual startup**
```bash
# Ensure NumPy compatibility
pip install "numpy<2.0,>=1.26.0"

# Start the server
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001
```

### 📊 Verification
Test that the fix worked:
```bash
# Test imports
python -c "import app.main; print('✅ App imports successfully')"

# Test server health (after starting)
curl http://127.0.0.1:8001/health
```

### 🔮 Future Prevention
The updated `requirements.txt` now specifies:
- `numpy<2.0,>=1.26.0` - Compatible version range
- This prevents automatic upgrades to NumPy 2.x

### 📝 Technical Notes
- This is a common issue when upgrading to NumPy 2.x
- Many ML/AI packages haven't updated to support NumPy 2.x yet
- The fix maintains full functionality while ensuring compatibility
- No features are lost - everything works exactly the same

### ✅ Status: FIXED
The AI Health Tracker now runs without NumPy compatibility issues!
