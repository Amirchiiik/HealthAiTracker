## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### **✅ Agent Recognition Test**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/agent/analyze-and-act" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]" \
  -d '{"health_analysis_id": 29, "auto_book_critical": true}'
```

**Result:** ✅ **SUCCESS**
```json
{
  "actions_taken": [
    "Attempted auto-booking: Earliest available appointment with Dr. Maria Endocrinova is on 2025-05-26 at 09:00. Please book manually if acceptable."
  ]
}
```

**Key Achievement:** The agent now **finds and recognizes** the Endocrinologist doctors! 🎉
