## API Updates - Groq Integration

### Latest Migration: OpenRouter ‚Üí Groq API

The system has been migrated from OpenRouter to Groq API for improved performance and reliability:

**Key Changes:**
- **API Provider**: Now using Groq API instead of OpenRouter
- **Model**: Updated to `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`
- **Environment Variable**: `GROQ_API_KEY` required instead of `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- **Performance**: Faster response times with Groq's optimized infrastructure

**Setup Requirements:**
```bash
# Set your Groq API key
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

All existing functionality remains the same - only the underlying AI provider has changed for better performance.
