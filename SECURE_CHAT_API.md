## üì± Usage Examples

### Patient-Doctor Communication Flow

1. **Patient sends initial message with lab results**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8001/chat/send" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer patient_token" \
  -F "receiver_id=2" \
  -F "message_text=Hello Dr. Smith, I received my blood test results and have some questions. Could you please review them?" \
  -F "file=@blood_test_results.pdf"
```

2. **Doctor reviews and responds**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8001/chat/send" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer doctor_token" \
  -F "receiver_id=1" \
  -F "message_text=Thank you for sharing your results. Your cholesterol levels are slightly elevated. I recommend dietary changes and a follow-up in 3 months."
```

3. **Patient checks conversation history**:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8001/chat/history?with_user=2" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer patient_token"
```

### File Sharing Best Practices

1. **Supported Medical Documents**:
   - Lab results (PDF, images)
   - Medical reports (DOC, DOCX)
   - X-rays and scans (JPEG, PNG, TIFF)
   - Prescription records (PDF, images)

2. **File Size Optimization**:
   - Compress large images before uploading
   - Use PDF format for text documents
   - Maximum file size: 10MB

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - Files are stored in user-specific directories
   - Only sender and receiver can download attachments
   - Files are automatically deleted when messages are deleted

## üîê Authentication Requirements

All chat endpoints require JWT authentication:

1. **Register** a user account (`/auth/register`)
2. **Login** to get JWT token (`/auth/login`)
3. **Include token** in Authorization header: `Bearer {token}`

## üìä Database Schema

### ChatMessage Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE chat_messages (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    sender_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    receiver_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    message_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    attachment_filename VARCHAR(255),
    attachment_path VARCHAR(500),
    attachment_size INTEGER,
    attachment_type VARCHAR(50),
    is_read VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'false',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python test_chat_system.py
```

The test suite covers:
- User authentication and role validation
- Message sending with and without files
- Conversation history retrieval
- Security and access control
- File upload and download
- Read receipt functionality

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Security Checklist
- [ ] HTTPS enabled for all communication
- [ ] File upload directory permissions properly set
- [ ] Regular database backups configured
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Audit logging enabled
- [ ] CORS properly configured for production domains

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Database indexes on sender_id, receiver_id, created_at
- [ ] File cleanup scheduled task for deleted messages
- [ ] Message pagination implemented
- [ ] Caching for conversation lists

## üè• HIPAA Compliance Features

- **Encryption**: All communications encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with authentication
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all communications
- **Data Isolation**: User-specific data storage
- **Secure File Handling**: Validated uploads with access control
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Configurable message retention policies

The secure chat system provides a robust foundation for patient-doctor communication while maintaining the highest security and privacy standards required for healthcare applications.

## üîó Integration with AI Health Analysis

The chat system seamlessly integrates with the existing AI health analysis features:

- Patients can share OCR-processed lab results directly in chat
- Doctors can review AI-generated health explanations
- Chat history preserves all medical communications for reference
- File attachments can be processed through the OCR system

This creates a complete healthcare communication ecosystem within the AI Health Tracker platform.
